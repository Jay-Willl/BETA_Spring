As announced in the [November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/110690), we continued to focus for two weeks on housekeeping GitHub issues and pull requests as documented in our [issue grooming guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming). Across all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) **5242** issues, which is even more than during our last housekeeping iteration in [October 2019](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40), where we closed **4622** issues. While we closed issues, you created **2937** new issues. The main [vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) now has 2146 open feature requests and 884 open bugs. In addition, we closed **144** pull requests.\r\n\r\nSame as every year, we used the [live tracker](https://vscode-issue-tracker.netlify.com/) from [Benjamin Lannon](https://github.com/lannonbr) to track our progress:\r\n\r\n![Burn down chart of VS Code issues](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_52/november-issue-grooming.png)\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on housekeeping, we have also addressed several feature requests and community [pull requests](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_thank-you). This resulted in many new features and settings, some of the key highlights include:\r\n\r\n* **[Word wrap in diff editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_word-wrap-in-the-diff-editor)** - Both inline and side-by-side views now support word wrapping.\r\n* **[New extension bisect feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_troubleshooting-extension-bisect)** - Troubleshoot which extensions are causing issues in VS Code.\r\n* **[Keyboard shortcuts editor improvements](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor)** - Create a keybinding from the Command Palette.\r\n* **[Undo file operations in Explorer](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_undo-file-operations-in-explorer)** - Undo or redo file operations in the Explorer.\r\n* **[New Git commands and settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_git-new-commands)** - Optimize your Version Control experience with new capabilities.\r\n* **[Preview editor improvements](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_preview-editor-improvements)** - Turn off preview editors altogether, and try new interaction models.\r\n* **[Sticky tab stops for spaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_sticky-tab-stops-when-indenting-with-spaces)** - Improved experience when indenting with spaces.\r\n* **[Improved word-based suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_wordbased-suggestions-from-other-documents)** - Display word-based suggestions from other open files.\r\n* **[Terminal configuration support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_terminal-configuration-support)** - Modify terminal settings from the terminal dropdown menu.\r\n* **[New Remote Development resources](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_documentation)** - Check out the new video and Learn module."
